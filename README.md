blimp 2.0

About
-----
So far blimp is a proof-of-concept application, built as a christmas present for my girlfriend chr. She absolutely loves blind maps. 

Next for Blimp is to make it to GitHub as a shared repository, and maybe get some further development in order to allow better gameplay.

For now the memory takes a hit when too many countries are involved (due to the detailed vectors), but hopefully I'll be able to sort it out. Other quirks to be solved are loading-indicators, saving, entering of name, share result, doge-graphics and so on.

### This version ...
... came to be in order to get a grip on Vue.js and a need to modularize previous versions as well. Various game modes will be added with hints instead of multiple choice questions. Design updates as well.
